        upd:"August 27, 2024", 
        data:`
        <article>
    <header>
      <p>In an era where digital interaction is a cornerstone of business, chatbots have become essential tools for enhancing customer engagement and automating services. However, the effectiveness of a chatbot largely depends on the quality of its flow—the sequence of interactions it uses to guide users toward their goals. In this blog, we’ll explore best practices for creating user-friendly chatbot flows that not only meet user needs but also drive conversion and satisfaction.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Start with the User in Mind</h2>
      <p>The foundation of any successful chatbot is a deep understanding of its users. To create a user-friendly chatbot flow, you must first know who your users are and what they need. Here’s how:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Define User Personas</strong>: Before you begin designing the chatbot flow, take the time to define the personas of the users who will interact with it. What are their goals, pain points, and preferred communication styles? By understanding these aspects, you can tailor the conversation to meet their specific needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Anticipate User Questions and Intents</strong>: Consider the types of questions users are likely to ask and the intents behind them. Whether it’s looking for product information, seeking support, or making a purchase, your chatbot should be prepared to handle a wide range of scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Simple, Natural Language</strong>: Communication is key in any interaction, and chatbots are no exception. Avoid jargon and overly complex language; instead, use simple, natural language that is easy for users to understand. This helps to build trust and keeps the conversation flowing smoothly.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Keep It Conversational and Contextual</h2>
      <p>A chatbot’s success hinges on its ability to engage users in a natural, conversational manner. Here’s how to achieve that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make It Human-Like</strong>: While users know they’re interacting with a bot, making the conversation feel more human can greatly enhance the user experience. Use friendly and approachable language, include small talk, and respond to user inputs in a way that feels natural.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain Context Throughout the Conversation</strong>: One of the most frustrating experiences for users is when a chatbot loses track of the conversation context. Ensure your bot can maintain context and provide relevant responses as the conversation progresses. This not only enhances user satisfaction but also reduces the likelihood of users abandoning the chat.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Relevant Information at the Right Time</strong>: Timing is crucial in chatbot interactions. Your bot should know when to offer information and when to ask questions. For example, if a user is browsing products, the chatbot could provide additional details or suggest similar items without overwhelming the user with too much information at once.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Guide Users Effectively</h2>
      <p>Effective guidance can transform a basic chatbot into a powerful tool for user engagement and conversion. Here’s how to guide users effectively through your chatbot flow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Quick Replies, Buttons, and Menus</strong>: One of the best ways to guide users is by offering them predefined options through quick replies, buttons, and menus. These elements simplify the decision-making process for users and help them navigate the conversation with ease.</li>
        <li><strong>Handle Multiple Intents in One Conversation</strong>: Users often have more than one query or intention when interacting with a chatbot. Design your flow to handle multiple intents gracefully. This could involve understanding context shifts, managing follow-up questions, and ensuring that the bot can pivot between different topics seamlessly.</li>
        <li><strong>Nudge Users Toward Desired Outcomes</strong>: Whether you want users to complete a form, make a purchase, or schedule a demo, subtle nudges within the chatbot flow can help guide them toward these goals. This can be achieved by strategically placing calls-to-action (CTAs) and providing relevant incentives or information that motivates the user to take the desired action.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Optimize for Mobile</h2>
      <p>With the majority of users accessing chatbots via mobile devices, it’s essential to optimize your chatbot flow for mobile:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Design for Mobile-First</strong>: Start your design process with mobile users in mind. This means shorter messages, touch-friendly buttons, and a layout that adapts well to smaller screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure Smooth Performance Across Devices</strong>: Your chatbot should work seamlessly across all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops. Test the flow on different devices and browsers to ensure a consistent and responsive experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it Fast and Lightweight</strong>: Mobile users expect quick and responsive interactions. Ensure your chatbot flow is optimized for speed by minimizing loading times and avoiding heavy elements that could slow down the conversation.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Creating a user-friendly chatbot flow is an art that combines understanding user needs with the technical know-how to guide them through a seamless conversation. By starting with the user in mind, keeping the conversation natural and contextual, guiding users effectively, and optimizing for mobile, you can create a chatbot that not only meets but exceeds user expectations.</p>
      <p>Remember, the key to a successful chatbot is continuous improvement. Regularly gather feedback, analyze user interactions, and iterate on your design to refine the flow and enhance the user experience. With these best practices, you’ll be well on your way to crafting chatbot flows that convert and delight users.</p>

    <header>
      <h1>WhatsApp Messaging Guidelines</h1>
      <p>WhatsApp is a simple, secure and reliable way to send messages and make calls. No one, not even WhatsApp, can see your personal messages which are end-to-end encrypted by default.</p>
      <p>These Messaging Guidelines (these “Guidelines”) apply to 1:1 chats, calls, group chats, and communities. Status updates are also subject to these Guidelines.</p>
      <p>Use of the WhatsApp Messenger Application is governed by our Terms of services and these Guidelines. The use of our Business Services, including the WhatsApp Business Application and the WhatsApp Business Platform are governed by the WhatsApp Business Terms of Services and business policies, in addition to these Guidelines.</p>
      <p>WhatsApp may take action against violations of our Terms of Service or these Guidelines, based on the limited information available to WhatsApp, including basic account, group, and community profile information, as well as messages reported by other users. Your personal messages and calls are always protected by end-to-end encryption.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Prohibited Content and Behavior</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do not share illegal content or engage in illegal activity:</strong> This includes content that sexually exploits or endangers children (including child sexual abuse material) or that supports designated terrorist organizations or individuals. Do not share intellectual property you do not have a right to use. Do not organize or coordinate violent crimes, violence against others, human trafficking, or trade in illicit drugs.</li>

        <li><strong>Do not engage in adversarial behavior:</strong> This includes efforts to undermine WhatsApp integrity systems, abuse reporting tools, compromise user accounts, scrape data, or use unofficial clients, bulk messaging, auto-messaging, auto-dialing, or automation to harm WhatsApp or our users.</li>

        <li><strong>Do not engage in fraud or spam:</strong> This includes repeated unwanted contact with WhatsApp users, and activity that scams or defrauds WhatsApp or our users through purposeful deception or impersonation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Users can report WhatsApp contacts, groups, communities, status updates, or specific messages that potentially violate these Guidelines. You can learn more about how to report on WhatsApp here. For information on how to report potential intellectual property violations, please see here.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Apply the Messaging Guidelines</h2>

      <h3>Automated Processing</h3>
      <p>WhatsApp may use both automated processing techniques and human review teams to detect and review information available to us including account, group, and community profile information, as well as reported messages, for potential violations of these Guidelines.</p>
      <p>Automated data processing is central to our review process and automates decisions for certain areas where account behavior or reported message content is highly likely to be in violation of these Guidelines.</p>
      <p>Automation also helps us prioritize and expedite reviews by routing potentially violating accounts, groups, or communities to human reviewers who have the right subject matter and language expertise, so our teams can focus on the most important cases first.</p>

      <h3>Human Review Teams</h3>
      <p>When an account, group or community requires further review, our automated systems send it to a human review team to make the final decision. Our human review teams are located across the globe, receive in-depth training, and often specialize in certain policy areas and regions, and are able to review account information and reported messages. Personal messages are protected by end-to-end encryption. Our automated systems learn and improve from each decision.</p>

      <h3>Local Law Violations</h3>
      <p>When governments believe accounts, groups, or communities on WhatsApp violate local law, they may request that we review the account information available to us. Personal messages and calls are always protected by end-to-end encryption. We may also receive court orders to restrict WhatsApp accounts. We always assess the legitimacy and completeness of a government request before taking any action.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Actions We May Take</h2>
      <p>When we become aware of illegal content or a violation of our terms and policies, we may take action, including the following, and depending on the nature of the content or violation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Warning users of violations of these Guidelines</li>
        <li>Temporarily or permanently suspending an account on our service</li>
        <li>Preventing further activity in groups and/or communities <a href="#">[more info here]</a></li>

        <li>Revoking or blocking use of a group or community’s invite link</li>
        <li>Reporting child sexual abuse material to NCMEC and/or competent authorities</li>
      </ul>

<strong>7. Our Data Practices</strong>

<p>
Your Customer Contacts. Company provides customer contact information such as phone numbers (“Customer Data”) to WhatsApp, and Company determines which of its customers it may communicate with using the WhatsApp service. To the extent any data protection or privacy law applicable to your use of WhatsApp’s Business Services recognizes the concepts of Controller and Processor and requires the conclusion of a data processing agreement between them (such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, “EU GDPR”), the “UK GDPR” (as defined in the UK Data Protection Act 2018), or the Brazilian "Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados” (Law 13.709/2018, “LGPD”; "Data Privacy Law"), you acknowledge that you are the Controller and instruct the WhatsApp entity you are contracting with, for the duration of these Business Terms, to Process any Personal Information in Customer Data on your behalf as your Processor to enable you to contact your customers on WhatsApp pursuant to these Business Terms and the WhatsApp Business Data Processing Terms. “Personal Information”, “Controller,” “Processor” and “Processing” in this section have the meanings set out in the WhatsApp Business Data Processing Terms which are incorporated by reference into these Business Terms.
</p>
<p>
Access to data, and to aggregated data. You, and your service providers who manage your WhatsApp Business communications for you, if any, will have access via our Business Services to personal data, such as Customer Data, and Company Content that you provide to us. As part of our Business Services, WhatsApp provides you with aggregated metrics relating to your messaging activity within our Business Services, such as the aggregate number of messages sent, delivered, and read. If you use a service provider to manage your WhatsApp Business communications for you, then by connecting your WhatsApp Business account and providing your service provider with account permissions, you instruct us to provide your service provider with access to these aggregated metrics.
</p>
<p>
Ranking and Rating. If you use catalog, you determine the order and display of your goods and services in your catalog; we do not rank or use ranking parameters within catalog to display your goods or services alongside or relative to any other business’ goods or services.
</p>
<p>
Other Information. You understand and agree that WhatsApp collects, stores, and uses: (a) information from your business account and registration; (b) usage, log, and functional information generated from your use of our Business Services; (c) performance, diagnostics, and analytics information; (d) information related to your technical or other support requests; and (e) information about you from other sources such as other WhatsApp users, businesses, third-party companies, and the other Meta Companies. Subject to these Business Terms and applicable law, we may share this information with the other Meta Companies, and we and the other Meta Companies will use it to develop, operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Business Services, our other services, and the services and products of the Meta Companies.
</p>
<p>
Our Global Operations. Company agrees to the transfer and processing of information that we collect, store, and use under these Business Terms, to the United States and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, or partners, regardless of where you use our Business Services. You acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed may be different from those of your own country.
</p>
<p>
Legal Disclosures and Third-Party Requests. You agree that WhatsApp may share your information, including Company Content, if we have good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond pursuant to applicable law or regulations, to legal process, or government requests; (b) enforce these Business Terms and any other applicable terms and policies, including for investigations of potential violations; (c) detect, investigate, prevent, and address fraud and other illegal activity, or security or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, WhatsApp, the other Meta Companies, or others.

        <article>
  <header>
    <p>To effectively implement opt-in best practices, businesses must ensure that users are fully aware of the types of messages they will receive and how to manage their preferences. Here’s a detailed breakdown:</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Setting Clear Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Comprehensive Opt-In:</strong> Businesses should acquire an opt-in that covers all the categories of messages users will receive, such as order updates, promotional offers, and product recommendations. By doing so, users are aware from the start of the different types of communications they will get, reducing the likelihood of feeling overwhelmed or spammed.</li>
      <li><strong>Specific Opt-Ins for Calls:</strong> If your business plans to make calls to users, obtain a separate opt-in specifically for this purpose. This ensures users are only contacted via call if they have explicitly agreed to it.</li>
      <li><strong>Category-Specific Opt-Ins:</strong> For a more tailored user experience, consider asking for separate opt-ins for each message category. For example, one opt-in for transactional messages and another for marketing messages. This segmentation helps manage user expectations and ensures they only receive content that is relevant to their preferences.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Mitigating User Discomfort</h2>
    <p>Users are more likely to block a business if they receive unsolicited messages. By following the above practices, businesses can significantly reduce this risk. When users know what to expect, they are less likely to feel annoyed or surprised by the messages they receive.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Clear Opt-Out Instructions</h2>
    <p>It’s equally important to provide users with straightforward instructions on how to opt-out of specific message categories or calls. This could be as simple as replying with a keyword like "STOP" or using a provided link. Honoring these requests promptly builds trust and ensures compliance with user preferences.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Intuitive Opt-In/Opt-Out Flows</h2>
    <p>The processes for opting in and out should be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Complex or confusing flows may deter users from engaging with your business or lead to frustration. Keep the steps clear and concise to encourage participation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Communicating Value</h2>
    <p>Clearly articulate the benefits of opting in to receive messages on WhatsApp. Whether it’s faster customer service, exclusive offers, or timely updates, users are more likely to opt-in when they perceive value in the messages they will receive.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Compliance and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>WhatsApp may evaluate your business’s opt-in practices, including reviewing user feedback. Ensuring your opt-in processes are transparent and user-centric helps mitigate the risk of policy violations. Over time, WhatsApp may introduce additional enforcement measures, so staying compliant is crucial.</p>
  </section>

    <p>By following these best practices, businesses can create a positive user experience, reduce the chances of being blocked, and ensure compliance with WhatsApp’s policies.</p>

        <article>

    <p>When your WhatsApp Business Account is suspended or terminated, it can be a significant disruption to your communication with customers. However, understanding the reasons behind such enforcement and knowing the steps to appeal can help you navigate this challenge effectively. Here's a detailed guide on what to do if your account is suspended or terminated:</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Understand Why Your Account Was Suspended or Terminated</h2>
    <p>WhatsApp takes the quality of conversations on its platform very seriously. Accounts that violate the WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy, WhatsApp Messaging Guidelines, or WhatsApp Business Terms of Service may face enforcement actions, including suspension or termination.</p>
    <p>Common reasons for account suspension or termination include sending unsolicited messages, failing to obtain proper opt-in from users, violating content policies, or engaging in activities that harm the user experience.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Evaluate Whether Your Account Violated Any Policies</h2>
    <p>Before appealing, it’s crucial to evaluate whether your account may have indeed violated any of WhatsApp's policies. Review the WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy and WhatsApp Business Terms of Service to identify any potential breaches.</p>
    <p>If you find that your practices may have inadvertently violated these policies, take immediate steps to correct them to avoid future enforcement actions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Appealing the Suspension or Termination</h2>
    <p>If you believe your account was mistakenly suspended or terminated, you have the right to appeal the decision. The process for appealing depends on whether you are using the WhatsApp Business App or the WhatsApp Business Platform.</p>

    <h3>For WhatsApp Business App Users:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit the Business Help Center for detailed instructions on how to submit an appeal. Make sure to provide any relevant information that supports your case, such as evidence that you have not violated any policies.</li>
      <li>Be clear and concise in your appeal, outlining why you believe the suspension or termination was a mistake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For WhatsApp Business Platform Users:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Refer to the Policy Enforcement - WhatsApp Business Platform page for guidance on how to appeal. This page will provide specific instructions on the appeal process, including the necessary steps and documentation required.</li>
      <li>It's essential to thoroughly document your appeal, providing evidence that your messaging practices comply with WhatsApp's guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Review Resources on Banned Accounts</h2>
    <p>For additional information on what to do if your account is banned, refer to the relevant article in the WhatsApp Help Center. This resource provides insights into the types of activities that can lead to account bans and offers guidance on how to avoid them in the future.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Preventing Future Suspensions</h2>
    <p>To avoid future suspensions or terminations, ensure that your business adheres strictly to WhatsApp’s policies. This includes obtaining proper opt-ins, respecting user preferences, and maintaining high-quality, relevant communications.</p>
    <p>Regularly review updates to WhatsApp’s policies to stay informed of any changes that may affect your business practices.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Stay Proactive</h2>
    <p>Being proactive in understanding and following WhatsApp’s guidelines is key to maintaining a healthy business account. If you encounter any uncertainties or need further clarification on policies, consult the WhatsApp Business Help Center or seek advice from experts familiar with WhatsApp’s regulations.</p>
  </section>

    "Policy for WhatsApp Commerce Features (including offering goods or services for sale)":{
        "upd":"August 27, 2024", 
        "data":`
        <article>
  <header>
    <p>When using WhatsApp’s commerce features to offer goods or services for sale, it's crucial to understand and adhere to the platform's policies to ensure smooth operations and compliance. WhatsApp's Commerce Policy outlines the responsibilities and restrictions that businesses must follow when using WhatsApp Business Services, such as catalogs and payment features.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Understanding the Commerce Policy</h2>
    <p>WhatsApp’s Commerce Policy governs the use of its platform for commercial purposes. If your business uses features like Catalogs to showcase products or services, or engages in any form of commerce through WhatsApp, you must comply with the Meta Commerce Policy. This policy is designed to ensure that businesses operate fairly and legally while using WhatsApp as a sales channel.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Compliance with Meta Commerce Policy</h2>
    <p>The Meta Commerce Policy is comprehensive and includes various rules that businesses must follow. These include restrictions on what can be sold, how products are presented, and the necessary disclosures that must be made to consumers. For instance, certain products or services may be prohibited, such as illegal substances, weapons, or adult content.</p>
    <p>It's essential to review and understand this policy thoroughly to ensure that your business offerings are compliant. Failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in the removal of your listings or even suspension of your WhatsApp Business Account.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Adhering to Laws and Regulations</h2>
    <p>In addition to WhatsApp’s policies, businesses must comply with all relevant laws and regulations governing commerce in their region. This includes consumer protection laws, data privacy regulations, and industry-specific rules that might apply to your products or services.</p>
    <p>Businesses are also responsible for providing clear terms of sale, privacy policies, and any other legal terms that govern transactions with customers. Transparency in these terms helps build trust and reduces the risk of disputes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Responsibility for Transactions</h2>
    <p>When using WhatsApp’s commerce features, the responsibility for managing transactions lies entirely with the business. This includes handling payments, order processing, and fulfillment. WhatsApp acts as a platform to facilitate these interactions but does not participate in the actual sales process.</p>
    <p>It is crucial for businesses to establish reliable systems for managing orders, processing payments securely, and delivering goods or services as promised. Any issues that arise, such as payment disputes or delivery problems, must be resolved directly between the business and the customer.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Taxation and Financial Obligations</h2>
    <p>Businesses are solely responsible for all financial aspects of their transactions on WhatsApp, including taxes. This means determining which taxes apply, collecting them appropriately, and ensuring that all necessary taxes, duties, fees, and additional charges are reported and remitted to the appropriate authorities.</p>
    <p>Understanding the tax implications of your sales, especially if you operate across multiple regions or countries, is vital. Consulting with a tax professional can help ensure that your business remains compliant with all relevant tax obligations.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Best Practices for Using WhatsApp Commerce Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keep Your Catalog Updated:</strong> Regularly update your product catalog with accurate descriptions, prices, and availability. This reduces the likelihood of customer dissatisfaction and ensures a smoother transaction process.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Clear Customer Support Channels:</strong> Make it easy for customers to reach you with questions or concerns. Prompt and effective communication is key to maintaining customer satisfaction.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Payment Processes:</strong> Use trusted payment gateways to process transactions and protect customer information. Security is paramount, especially when handling sensitive financial data.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <footer>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Using WhatsApp’s commerce features offers businesses a convenient way to reach customers and sell products or services directly through the platform. However, it comes with responsibilities that must be taken seriously. By adhering to the Meta Commerce Policy, complying with all relevant laws, and managing transactions responsibly, businesses can successfully leverage WhatsApp as a powerful commerce tool.</p>
    <p>Staying informed and proactive in managing your business practices on WhatsApp will help you build trust with your customers and ensure long-term success on the platform.</p>

    <h1>WhatsApp Business Platform: Government and Political Use Policy</h1>
    <p>When it comes to the use of the WhatsApp Business Platform, particularly by government and political entities, there are specific policies in place to ensure that the platform is used responsibly and ethically. These policies are designed to maintain the integrity of communications on WhatsApp and to prevent misuse, especially in sensitive areas like politics and national security.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Government Use of WhatsApp Business Platform</h2>
    <p>WhatsApp permits the use of its Business Platform by government entities. However, this access must be facilitated through a Solution Provider (previously known as Business Service Provider). Solution Providers are authorized third-party companies that offer specialized services to help businesses and organizations effectively use WhatsApp’s tools and features.</p>
    <p>Government entities using WhatsApp for public communication can benefit from this platform for providing services like customer support, public notifications, and information dissemination. However, they must work within the confines of the policies set forth by WhatsApp to ensure compliance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Prohibition on Political Use</h2>
    <p><strong>Political Parties, Politicians, and Campaigns:</strong> WhatsApp strictly prohibits the use of its Business Platform by political parties, politicians, political candidates, and political campaigns. This policy is in place to prevent the platform from being used for political propaganda, mass messaging during elections, or any activities that could be perceived as manipulating public opinion.</p>
    <p><strong>Entities Related to Politics:</strong> Additionally, entities that offer services related to politics—such as political campaign strategies, political consulting, or companies providing voting solutions—are also barred from using the WhatsApp Business Platform. This prohibition extends to private companies that provide election-related services and exclusive government service providers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Prohibition on Use by Security Agencies</h2>
    <p>WhatsApp also prohibits its Business Platform from being used by Law Enforcement Agencies, Military Services, National Security, and Intelligence Agencies. This restriction aims to protect the platform from being utilized for surveillance, intelligence gathering, or any activities related to national security that could infringe on user privacy or lead to misuse of the platform’s capabilities.</p>
    <p>The focus here is to maintain WhatsApp as a communication tool for businesses and public services that operate transparently and ethically, avoiding any involvement in sensitive or classified activities.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Responsible Use of WhatsApp</h2>
    <p>For government entities permitted to use the platform, it is crucial to adhere to WhatsApp’s guidelines and use the platform responsibly. This means ensuring that communication is clear, ethical, and in the public interest. It also involves respecting user privacy and avoiding any practices that could be seen as intrusive or inappropriate.</p>
    <p>WhatsApp encourages responsible communication practices and provides resources on how to use the platform appropriately in different contexts, including government communication.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Resources and Further Guidance</h2>
    <p>WhatsApp offers additional guidance on the responsible use of the platform for government and political entities. For more detailed information, the <em>Building Community on WhatsApp</em> page provides insights into how WhatsApp can be used effectively while respecting the platform’s policies.</p>
    <p>For information specifically related to the use of WhatsApp during elections, the <em>WhatsApp and Elections</em> page offers guidelines on how to navigate the complexities of political communication, ensuring that the platform is used in a way that upholds democratic principles and integrity.</p>
  </section>

  <footer>
    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The policies surrounding the government and political use of WhatsApp are designed to protect the platform from misuse while ensuring that it remains a tool for transparent, ethical communication. By prohibiting political and security-related use, WhatsApp aims to maintain a clear distinction between commercial, public service communications, and politically sensitive activities.</p>
    <p>Government entities that are permitted to use the WhatsApp Business Platform must do so through approved channels and with a commitment to responsible use, ensuring that their communication aligns with WhatsApp’s policies and the broader principles of transparency and accountability.</p>
    <p>Understanding and adhering to these policies is crucial for any government or public entity considering the use of WhatsApp as part of their communication strategy. By following these guidelines, organizations can leverage the power of WhatsApp to engage with the public effectively while maintaining the trust and integrity that the platform is known for.</p>

        <article>
       <section>
  <h2>Conversation Based Pricing</h2>
  <p>This document explains how conversation-based pricing works on the WhatsApp Business Platform.</p>

  <p>Charges are applied per conversation, not per individual message sent or received.</p>

  <p>Conversations are 24-hour message threads between you and your customers. They are opened and charged when messages you send to customers are delivered. The criteria that determines when a conversation is opened and how it is categorized is explained below.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Conversation Categories</h2>
  <p>Conversations are categorized with one of the following categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Marketing</strong> — Enables you to achieve a wide range of goals, from generating awareness to driving sales and retargeting customers. Examples include new product, service, or feature announcements, targeted promotions/offers, and cart abandonment reminders.</li>
    <li><strong>Utility</strong> — Enables you to follow-up on user actions or requests. Examples include opt-in confirmation, order/delivery management (e.g., delivery update); account updates or alerts (for example, payment reminder); or feedback surveys.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication</strong> — Enables you to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges).</li>
    <li><strong>Service</strong> — Enables you to resolve customer inquiries.</li>
    <li>Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations can only be opened with template messages. Service conversations can be opened with any type of message other than a template message.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>See <a href="#">Message Types</a> to learn more about the various types of messages you can send to customers.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Opening Conversations</h2>
  <p>Conversations are opened when you send a message to a customer under the following conditions.</p>

  <h3>Marketing, Utility, and Authentication Conversations</h3>
  <p>When you send an approved marketing, utility, or authentication template to a customer, we check if an open conversation matching the template's category already exists between you and the customer. If one exists, no new conversation is opened. If one does not exist, a new conversation of that category is opened, lasting 24 hours.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hour 0: You send a targeted promotion (marketing template message) to a customer. No open marketing conversation exists between you and the customer, so a marketing conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.</li>
    <li>Hour 4: The customer completes an order on your site, so you send them an order confirmation (utility template message). No open utility conversation exists between you and the customer, so a utility conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.</li>
    <li>Hour 10: You send a shipment confirmation (utility template message) to the customer. An open utility conversation already exists between you and the customer, so a new utility conversation is not opened.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To learn more about template categories and how to choose an appropriate category when creating templates, see <a href="#">Template Categorization</a>.</p>
  <p>For additional examples, see our <a href="#">pricing explainer PDF</a>.</p>

  <h3>Service Conversations</h3>
  <p>A service conversation is opened when any message other than a template message is delivered to your customer and no open conversation of any category exists between you and the customer.</p>

  <p>Note that a customer service window must exist between you and the customer before you can send them a non-template message.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hour 0: You send a targeted promotion (marketing template) to a customer. No open marketing conversation exists between you and the customer, so a marketing conversation lasting 24 hours is opened.</li>
    <li>Hour 4: The customer messages you. This opens a customer service window between you and the customer, allowing you to send them any type of message for the next 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Hour 5: You send an interactive list message to the customer. An open conversation already exists between you and the customer (a marketing conversation in this case), so a service conversation is not opened.</li>
    <li>Hour 24: The marketing conversation expires.</li>
    <li>Hour 25: The 24-hour customer service window is still open, so you send a second text message to the customer. No open conversation exists between you and the customer anymore, so a service conversation is opened, lasting 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Hour 26: The 24-hour customer service window is still open, so you send a third text message to the customer. An open service conversation already exists between you and the customer, so a new service conversation is not opened.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For additional examples, see our <a href="#">pricing explainer PDF</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Customer Service Windows</h2>
  <p>See <a href="#">Customer Service Windows</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Conversation Duration</h2>
  <p>Marketing, utility, authentication, and service conversations last 24 hours unless closed by a newly opened free-entry point conversation.</p>
  <p>Free-entry point conversations last 72 hours.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Multiple Conversations</h2>
  <p>It is possible to have multiple open conversations between you and a customer. This can happen in the following situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An open marketing, utility, or authentication conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them a template message of a different category within 24 hours.</li>
    <li>An open service conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them a template message within 24 hours.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Free Tier Conversations</h2>
  <p>Each WhatsApp Business Account gets 1,000 free service conversations each month across all of its business phone numbers. This number is refreshed at the beginning of each month, based on WhatsApp Business Account time zone.</p>
  <p>Marketing, utility and authentication conversations are not part of the free tier.</p>
</section>

<h2>Free Entry Point Conversations</h2>
<p>A free entry point conversation is opened if (1) a customer using a device running Android or iOS messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad or Facebook Page Call-to-Action button and (2) you respond within 24 hours. If you do not respond within 24 hours, a free entry point conversation is not opened and you must use a template to message the customer, which opens a marketing, utility, or authentication conversation, per the category of the template.</p>

<p>The free entry point conversation is opened as soon as your message is delivered and lasts 72 hours. When a free entry point conversation is opened, it automatically closes all other open conversations between you and the customer, and no new conversations will be opened until the free entry point conversation expires.</p>

<p>Once the free entry point conversation is opened, you can send any type of message to the customer without incurring additional charges. However, you can only send non-templates messages if there is an open customer service window between you and the customer.</p>

<p>For example, if the customer messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad at 10am and you respond via a template message at 10pm the same day:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The free entry point conversation starts at 10pm and lasts 72 hours.</li>
  <li>You can send template messages at no charge in those 72 hours.</li>
  <li>You can send non-template messages until 10am the next day, at which point the customer service window closes, as it is independent of the free entry point conversation (if the customer messages you again, however, it opens another 24-hour customer service window in which you can send any type of message).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rates</h2>
<p>Rates vary based on conversation category and country/region rate. You can download the rate card below that corresponds to your WhatsApp Business Account's currency to see our rates by country/region for each conversation category.</p>

<p>These rates apply for any conversation opened on or after June 1, 2023 at 12:00 AM, based on WhatsApp Business Account time zone.</p>

  <h2>Verifying Your Facebook Business Manager Account</h2>
  <p>
    Verifying your Facebook Business Manager account is essential if you want to send WhatsApp messages to more than 50 unique users per day. Once your Facebook Business Manager ID is verified, you can send messages to anywhere from 1,000 to an unlimited number of users daily using the WhatsApp Business API via 24by7chat.
  </p>
  <p>Here's a step-by-step guide to get you through the verification process.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Preparation for Verification</h2>
  <p>Before you start the verification process, ensure you have the following ready:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Website URL</li>
    <li>Business Email ID</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Official Documents:</strong> These should include your company’s legal name and address. Recommended documents:
      <ul>
        <li>GST Certificate</li>
        <li>Bank Statement</li>
        <li>Electricity Bill</li>
        <li>Company Registration Document (should include both legal name and address)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <pre><code>Copyright © 2024 XYZ Limited, All rights reserved.</code></pre>
  <p>Replace "XYZ Limited" with your legal name.</p>
